			<p>Where do you go to get the best information about the scores of vendors that exist in the marketplace today?

				the mess and find your favorite juice and the best vendors.

			<h3>Our patented 3 step process!</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Get as many submissions as possible.</li>
				<li>Have as many people as possible vote for their favorites.</li>
				<li>Buy all the juices that make it to the top.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Most importantly, provide what the community wants!</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I'm open to suggestions, what do YOU want to see? If enough people agree, I'll implement it.</li>
				<li>This site is in active development with a planned feature list almost to large to document...but here are the cliff notes:</li>
				
			</ul>

			<h3>Currently planned features!</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Hardware and Vendor rankings. (Vendor votes will reset monthly or so)</li>
				<li>A full user management backend, track your favorite juices, comments and more.</li>
				<li>Really, really, really cool customizable user banners.</li>
				<li>Affiliate free advertising for Vendors.</li>
				<li>All sorts of additional information about juices, price, best cart/atomizer/voltage etc..</li>	
			</ul>

				<h3>Rules.</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>No fraud. No multiple accounts.</li>
				<li>Vendors: Submit at your own peril... Meaning don't come crying to us if your juice is nasty and gets alot of hate.</li>
				<li>Vendors: Do not submit your entire lineup all at once. I know it's tempting, but try to pace yourself.</li>
				<li>No negative submissions. VapeRank classifies GOOD juice. If you dont have something good to say, dont say it.</li>
				<li>Users: Feel free to give your opinion in the comments - good or bad - about a particular juice, just do it without dropping F-bombs.</li>
				
			</ul>
